		<h1>Stroke IV</h1>
		<h2>Recovering From Stroke</h2>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">To get better, most people need help from lots of different professionals in hospital. This is called rehabilitation, and it is how people relearn to do things like walking, talking and writing. Here are some people you may meet at the hospital which have a key role in helping your loved one:</p>
		<ul class="strokeList">
			<li>Doctors are in charge of someone's medical care in hospital.</li><br>
			<li>Nurses are the main carers in hospitals. They make sure that everyone is safe and as comfortable as possible. They can help the patient get out of bed and eat and drink during meal times.</li><br>
			<li>Physiotherapists help people who have problems walking or standing up, or using their arms and hands.</li><br>
			<li>Occupational therapists help people do everyday things like getting dressed.</li><br>
			<li>Speech therapists assist those who have speaking difficulties, or even reading, writing or swallowing.</li><br>
		</ul>

		<p>When a person who has had a stroke comes home from the hospital, they may even need to keep seeing their doctor or other health professionals. Many people do get better, but they may not be able to do everything they did before they had the stroke.</p><br><p class="invisibleText">Wow, these ghosts are everywhere!</p><br>

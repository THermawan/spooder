		<a id="arteriesAndVeins"><h2>Arteries and Veins</h2></a>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">Have you ever seen a road map? If you have, you've probably noticed there are roads going everywhere. Your body, too, has a highway system that sends blood to and from different body parts. This system is called the circulatory system, and those roads, like in a map, are called the arteries and veins. Arteries, which usually look red, carry blood and nutrients away from the heart. Veins, which usually look blue, return blood to the heart, ready to be filled with oxygen and nutrients before being pumped out again through arteries.</p><br>

		<a id="blockage"><h2>Blockage</h2></a>

		<p class="clearOfImage">When germs get inside your body, they can multiply and cause an infection. Your body's immune system fights off the germs with special cells. It can become a full-on fight against the nasty invaders â€“ and you won't feel better until your body wins! Sometimes when you get sick, it's because you have some kind of infection. If your body's having a little trouble fighting the infection by itself, your doctor may prescribe medicine like antibiotics to help, so just sit back, get some rest, and let your body do the work!</p><br>

		<h1>Stroke II</h1>
		<h2>What Happens During a Stroke?</h2>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">Strokes usually happen out of the blue. When a person experiences stroke, you (or they) might notice these signs:</p>
		<ul class="strokeList">
			<li><a href="glossary.html#numbness">Numbness, or weakness on one side of the body</a></li><br>
			<li>A very bad headache</li><br>
			<li>Dizziness</li><br>
			<li><a href="glossary.html#Fever">Fever</a></li><br>
			<li>Vomiting</li><br>
			<li>Loss of balance or co-ordination</li><br>
			<li>Trouble talking or understanding what people are saying</li><br>
			<li>Trouble seeing</li><br>
			<li>Confusion</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If someone you know is experiencing these things, they should get to the hospital straight away - or call 000 for help. Once they get medical attention, the first thing the doctor will do is make sure the person can breathe. Then, the doctor will try to find out what might be causing the problem by running tests on the heart and the brain. A special kind of x-ray, called a <a href="glossary.html#ctScan">CT scan</a>, will show if the person is having a stroke or has had a stroke by checking what part of the brain has been affected and how.</p><br>
		<p class="clearOfImage"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHzz2cXBlGk">This video</a> can help you remember how to tell if someone's having a stroke. (Just remember that the emergency number is 000 is Australia, not 911).</p>

		<h2 class="clearOfImage">Keeping Stroke Away</h2>
		<p class="clearOfImage">You know now that strokes can be pretty nasty - scary, even! Here's how you can <a href="glossary.html#prevent">prevent</a> (avoid) stroke and other health-related problems:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Eat healthy! Fruits and veggies are good for you, but not all healthy foods taste bad. (Psst! If you ask your parents to check out our 'for parents' page, we can show them how to make healthy food that tastes good! [External note: Feature pending.])</li><br>
			<li>Be active. Play outside. Pick up a sport. Do some exercise for a good amount every day, like running! If you do that, maybe later you can brag to your friends about how much better you are at running than them.</li><br>
			<li>Make sure you get enough sleep every night! Eight hours is a pretty good number. (That means you too, Chris.)</li><br>
			<li>Check your blood pressure regularly. Ask your parents if your doctor can do this for you.</li><br>
			<li>Don't ignore health problems, or if you just plain don't feel very well! They don't always go away, and they can get pretty nasty :(</li><br>

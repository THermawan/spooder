		<h1>Stroke</h1>
		<h2>What is a Stroke?</h2>
		<p class="firstUnderH2"><a href="glossary.html#strokeDef">"Stroke"</a> is a word that people sometimes use to describe something that can be pretty good (like stroking your pet's fur, or a stroke of luck - those are pretty nice things!) or something that can be pretty bad. When we talk about stroke on this website, we're talking about something pretty bad: stroke is a serious health problem that can affect a lot of people if they're not careful.</p>
		<p>Our bodies need a steady supply of blood for them to work properly. We don't normally have to worry about this - our hearts are very good at making sure that our blood goes where it needs to go! This blood carries <a href="glossary.html#oxygen">oxygen</a> and all sorts of <a href="glossary.html#nutrients">nutrients</a> that our bodies need to work, and is pumped through very thin tubes in our bodies called <a href="glossary.html#bloodVessels">blood vessels</a>, or <a href="glossary.html#arteriesAndVeins">arteries and veins</a>. Without it, the <a href="glossary.html#cells">cells</a> in our bodies won't work!</p>
		<p>When some parts of our <a href="glossary.html#brain">brain</a> don't get the blood they need to function, they might become damaged and might stop working altogether. This is what we call a stroke. Strokes usually occur because there's a <a href="glossary.html#blockage">blockage</a> that stops blood from getting to the brain - and sometimes, these blockages can cause blood vessels to <a href="glossary.html#burst">burst</a> and cause other problems. We also call this a stroke, because the reasons are very similar.</p>

		<h2>Types of Stroke</h2>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">The most common type of stroke is when blood can't go where it's supposed to because a blood vessel leading to the brain has become blocked. This usually happens because of a <a href="glossary.html#bloodClot">blood clot</a>, and it's nasty. The big, fancy word for this is <b>ischemic stroke.</b></p>
		<p>Sometimes, brain cells are destroyed because of a weak or thin blood vessel bursting, which causes blood to spill out. This is called <b>hemorrhagic (hem-oh-reh-jik) stroke</b> and happen more often when the walls of vessels have been weakened by <a href="glossary.html#highBloodPressure">high blood pressure.</a></p><br><br>

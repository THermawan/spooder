		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>Concerning the Site</h2>
		<h3>What is MiniMeds? Why are we here?</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">MiniMeds is a website geared towards educating children on the subjects of stroke and integrative medicine in fun and meaningful ways. We are here to both help children understand a topic that people generally don't want to talk about around them, and encourage healthy habits and behaviours that will be beneficial throughout their entire lives.</p>

		<h3>Isn't stroke much more relevant to adults than it is to children? Why is your target audience so young?</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">It is, but there are already many resources out there directed at helping older demographics in understanding and dealing with stroke. MiniMeds holds itself to a philosophy that prevention is better than a cure - and the sooner an individual picks up on healthy, preventative behaviours, the more effective they will be. There is also the added benefit that these behaviours tend to improve a person's overall wellbeing - and another thing to note is that there may be young relatives of recovering stroke victims who are struggling to understand what's going on - that's where we come in.</p>

		<h3>Is MiniMeds ever going to cost me anything?</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">No, MiniMeds will never charge you for any service provided on this site.</p>

		<h3>I was told there were going to be games! Where are all the videogames?</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">They haven't been developed yet! Come back in a week or two or five and they might be, though.</p>

		<h2 class="clearOfImage">Concerning Stroke</h2>
		<h3 class="clearOfImage">Someone I really care about just had a stroke! Will they ever be the same again?</h3>
		<p class="clearOfImage">That depends on the severity of the stroke. Small-scale strokes generally mean that recovery is quick, and things will soon return to normal. More destructive strokes, however, can cause severe, possibly permanent damage. Things can get pretty rough, but don't give up hope! Things will get better.</p>

		<h3 class="clearOfImage">I want to know more about/I have some more concerns about stroke. Who should I talk to?</h3>
		<p class="clearOfImage">There are many places you can go to or contact for help. The first point of contact should be your family: your parents, older siblings, other relatives. Teachers and counsellors are also often willing to help, if they can find the time. If you just want to know about stroke, or being healthy in general, there are <a href="https://strokefoundation.com.au/">many</a>, <a href="http://brainfoundation.org.au/disorders/stroke">many</a> <a href="http://www.healthdirect.gov.au/stroke">great</a> <a href="http://kidshealth.org/">websites</a> for you to look through. If you have some concerns and you just need to talk to someone, <a href="http://www.kidshelpline.com.au/">Kids Helpline</a> is always there for you.</p>

		<h3 class="clearOfImage">How do I know that stroke won't happen to me or someone close to me?</h3>
		<p class="clearOfImage">There's no real way of knowing whether or not someone will have a stroke - but you <b>can</b> dramatically reduce the possibility of getting one by being healthy and active. MiniMeds is here to help you with that!</p>

		<h3 class="clearOfImage">How can integrative medicine help stroke?</h3>
		<p class="clearOfImage">Integrative medicine focuses on combining conventional and complementary approaches, treatments and products that prioritise treating the patient and ensuring the patient's wellbeing above all else. This can be quite helpful in helping stroke patients during the recovery process and maintaining a healthy watch on their personal wellbeing, but is by no means a foolproof method of stroke preventation.</p></section>

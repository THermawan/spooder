		<h1>Integrative Medicine</h1>
		<h2>Conventional and Complementary Medicine</h2>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">To understand what is meant by Integrative Medicine (IM), you should know the difference between Conventional Medicine and Complementary Medicine.</p><hr>

		<h3>Conventional Medicine</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">When you are sick and go to the doctor's, they give you medicine to make you feel better as well as fight the infection or heal the wound you have. This is called conventional medicine, a system which is used by doctors and nurses all over the world to treat <a href="glossary.html#disease">diseases</a>, <a href="glossary.html#infection">infections</a> and symptoms. This usually involves treatments like <a href="glossary.html#prescriptionDrugs">prescription drugs</a>, <a href="glossary.html#radiation">radiation</a> or surgery. Conventional medicine is more commonly practised around the world.</p>
		<p>It can also be referred to as allopathic medicine, biomedicine, mainstream medicine, orthodox medicine, and Western medicine. People make up a lot of big words for this sort of thing! Don't worry if you don't know what they all mean; they all mean the same thing.</p>

		<h3>Complementary Medicine</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">Healing practices that are not used in conventional medicine (that's what we were just talking about!) are known as complementary medicine. These can include using natural products, like vitamins and herbs, or mind and body practices, such as acupuncture, massage and yoga. Complementary medicine is not widely taught in medical schools and is therefore not as frequency used by doctors.</p>
		
		<h3>Integrative Medicine</h3>
		<p class="firstUnderH2">More often, people blend complementary and conventional medicines for an effective treatment. This is known as Integrative Medicine. Using both systems in a coordinated way means better health and faster healing. An example of this is pain management. The doctor may write a prescription for pain medication and massage therapy for chronic back pain.</p>

		<h3 class="clearOfImage">Risk</h3>
		<p class="clearOfImage">While IM seems like a promising approach, few scientific studies have been done to prove its effectiveness. Most of these studies have been done on adults and not children. Prayer, massage and yoga and generally considered safe complements to regular medical treatment prescribed by a doctor, but some therapies - such as herbs and diet supplements - might have risks. Taking certain herbs can cause allergic reactions, liver damage or even death.</p><br>

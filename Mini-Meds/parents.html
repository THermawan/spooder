			<h1>For Parents</h1>
			<p>First of all, you're going to want to read over our <a href="privacyPolicy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. We're very serious about that. Finished reading? Good! Here's a breakdown on how Minimeds can help you and your child.</p>
			<h2>Helping Kids Understand Stroke</h2>
			<p class="firstUnderH2">Talking about stroke can be daunting for any parent, especially when it comes to children. Stroke affects everyone close to the survivor, and children are no exception. In most cases, they will be curious about the physical effects, scared by emotional ups and downs, or confused about why things have changed.</p><br>

			<h2>On Telling/Not Telling</h2>
			<p class="firstUnderH2">Protecting kids is natural instinct and first reaction for any parent, but kids can be extremely perceptive and are more aware of their surroundings than we might think. As tempting as it may be to not tell them what happens in the event of a stroke, they do need to know what's going on, and we're here to help you talk to your children about this in a way that makes sense to them.</p><br>

			<h2>Talking About Stroke</h2>
			<p class="firstUnderH2">Children and adolescents can be inquisitive, they may want to know what caused the stroke, whether they will have one, how to avoid them and whether it will happen again or not. It is imperative to remember that something that may seem obvious to you, might not be to a child, so make sure you are reassuring them and letting them know that everything will be ok and that their loved one is getting the help they need.</p><br>
			<p class="clearOfImage">Explaining to the children why the stroke has changed the persons physical appearance or body is really significant. If a loved one is unable to walk or talk or play with your child, make sure that you help them understand that it is not their fault they have done nothing wrong.</p><br>
			<p class="clearOfImage">Emotional and personality changes can also be one of the side effects of stroke. As they might not completely understand what is going on and why it is happening, it cab be confusing for a child to see a loved one having an emotional outburst, crying and being frustrated. A sufficient way to explain these changes can be to explain that like a body, emotions can be affected when there is damage to the brain.</p><br>

			<h2 class="clearOfImage">Considering Age</h2>
			<p class="clearOfImage">How a child reacts and how they make sense of stroke can be influenced by a child'	s age and developmental stage.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="whoaText">Children ages 2-7 may be inclined to believe that their own actions have direct consequences on the world around them and may believe that they are somehow to blame for the stroke. They might think that illnesses are contagious and worry that they will also get sick. In simple terms, try and discuss the stroke and set their mind at rest telling them that they are certainly not to blame and that strokes are not contagious. In this case, the most important thing is to stress to them that their loved one will be ok and is getting the help they need.</li><br>
				<li class="whoaText">Children ages 8-13 are able to understand illnesses on a more fundamental level. They may want to know the reasons why stroke happen, what the causes are and the symptoms. Try to remain open and as honest as possible when communicating about stroke to them in simple terms. Some children might want to search more on the internet for information; and to avoid misinformation, we can suggest looking it up tighter and using the resources on this website to help them gain an understanding into this area. Also, suggesting to the child's teacher to integrate learning about stroke in class may help the child be more open to asking questions without feeling embarrassed.</li>
			</ul><br><br>

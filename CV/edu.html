				<ul class="list">
					<li><b>&nbsp; &#x266a; <i>Encore Honour Roll, 2015.</i></b> Won a prize for being able to talk people's ears off about music.</li><br>
					<li><b>&nbsp; &#x1f4bb; <i>Microsoft Research Prize for Junior Software Development Projects, 2016.</i></b> It's for the website I sent alongside this, actually. Was a group project, but I did a lot of the prettying-up.</li><br>
					<li><b>&nbsp; &#x2694; <i>Society for Creative Anachronism.</i></b> So you make friends, right, and then you get those friends in armour and fight them. Think martial arts, but with swords and armour and historical research. And war.</li><br>
					<li><b>&nbsp; &#x1f451; <i>Tabletop Roleplaying Games.</i></b> I've been GMing for about eight years now, and I'd describe it a lot like collaborative storytelling - or if videogames had a living, breathing component that responds dynamically to your decisions as you play. There's a lot of rewarding work involved in Gamemastering - crafting what are effectively experiences for a small group of people over a long period of time requires a lot of investment in time and the development of communication and organisational skills, but watching my friends talk animatedly about a scenario I've presented to them long after it's over (and then proceeding to tell THEIR friends about it) gives me life.</li><br>
					<li><b>&nbsp; &#x1f4dd; <i>Writing.</i></b> Probably not a surprise at this point. I like to think I can write pretty well. Bit out of practice nowadays, though.</li>
